Got it üëç I unpacked your uploaded file **`Ittia.zip`** and analyzed the project.
Here‚Äôs a **summary list** of its structure and purpose:

---

## üì¶ **Project Analysis: Ittia.zip**

### 1. **Overall Purpose**

* Prototype of an **EMR (Electronic Medical Record) application** called **GDSEMRittia**.
* Built for **physicians**, focusing on:

  * Simplified text input
  * Abbreviation expansion
  * Generating standardized letters
  * Reducing time spent on manual documentation

---

### 2. **Technology Stack**

* **Java** (main programming language)
* **JavaFX** (primary UI framework, replacing Swing in newer parts)
* **SQLite** (local database for abbreviations, problem lists, ICD codes, etc.)
* **Gradle multi-module** build (app, utilities, list, build-logic)

---

### 3. **Main Features**

* **Text Area Management**

  * 10 central EMR sections (CC, PI, ROS, PMH, S, O, PE, A, P, Comment)
  * Abbreviation auto-expansion (e.g., "\:cd" ‚Üí current date)
  * Focus switching and double-click expansion

* **Problem List Management**

  * SQLite-backed DB (`prolist.db`) for managing diagnoses
  * F/U (follow-up) templates and editing functions

* **Template System**

  * Pre-defined **SOAP** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note structures
  * Letter generation for patient documentation

* **Bridge System (`IttiaAppMain`)**

  * Connects UI components (10 TextAreas) with helper dialogs and modules
  * Ensures consistency across the EMR

* **Helper Modules**

  * `EMRPMH` (Past Medical History manager)
  * `ChiefComplaintEditor`
  * `FreqInputFrame` (Vitals, BMI, HbA1c calculator)
  * `VaccineSideEffect` (adverse effect tracker)

---

### 4. **Databases**

* **Abbreviation DB** (`abbreviations.db`) ‚Äì expands shorthand into medical terms.
* **Problem List DB** (`prolist.db`) ‚Äì structured follow-up problems.
* **ICD/KCD DBs** (e.g., `icd11.db`, `kcd8db.db`) ‚Äì for diagnostic coding.

---

### 5. **Directory Structure**

* **`app/`** ‚Üí main EMR application code (JavaFX).
* **`list/`** ‚Üí data structures (problem lists, disease codes).
* **`utilities/`** ‚Üí common utility classes (DB managers, converters).
* **`build-logic/`** ‚Üí custom Gradle convention plugins.
* **`resources/`** ‚Üí databases (`.db`), templates, images.

---

### 6. **UI Design Principles**

* Minimal, physician-friendly layout.
* Toolbar with quick-action buttons (Vitals, Templates, Copy All).
* Abbreviation expansion **in-place** (reduces typing effort).
* Style themes (Sky Blue, Lemon gradient, Van Gogh-inspired).

---

### 7. **Current Development Focus**

* Migrating from Swing ‚Üí JavaFX (`IttiaAppTextArea`, `IAMTextArea`).
* Improving **TextArea manager** with better parsing and formatting.
* Enhancing **template insertion** and **auto-format** functions.
* Managing `.gitignore` rules for DB files (keep some in repo, ignore others).

---

‚úÖ **In summary**:
This project is an **EMR prototype** built with **JavaFX + SQLite**, structured in a **Gradle multi-module** setup. Its main innovations are in **text entry simplification (abbreviation expansion, templates, SOAP structure)** and **integration of helper medical modules** (problem list, vitals, vaccines, ICD/KCD databases).

üëâ Do you want me to also make a **visual directory tree** of the project (like `tree` output) so you see the full layout at a glance?
